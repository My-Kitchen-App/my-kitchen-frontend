# my-kitchen-frontend
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Description

- This app takes in available ingredients from the user and calls upon the spoonacular API to present the user a variety of recipes using said ingredients. The app consists of a backend RESTful API built with express and node.js, and a React client frontend using the bootstrap library.
- The vision of My Kitchen is to create an app that allows users to enter their available ingredients and receive a variety of recipes that incorporate them, and provide complementary wine pairings.
- My Kitchen aims to solve the logistical dilemma of using remaining pantry items and incorporating them into delicious recipes with wine pairing suggestions.
